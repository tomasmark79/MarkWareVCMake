# MarkWare VCMake Template 🎁
v1.1.0rc2
---

### Project Overview

- Another C++ template based on a modern structured foundation.
- This template incorporates the best ideas from environments like **VSCode**, **Modern CMake**, **CPM**, **ModernCppStarter**, and **C/C++**.
- It serves as a CMake wrapper replacement for the official CMake extension, which did not meet my specific needs.

#### The Fact

With this project and its settings, you can start developing in C++ within a few seconds.

### This C++ Template Project Consists of Two Parts:

- A C++ library
- A C++ standalone application that links with the library
  
### Implemented Features 

✅ - VSCode tasks for comfort  
✅ - VSCode key bindings template  
✅ - VSCode C/C++ debugger launcher  
✅ - Project renamer is awesome  
✅ - Debug - **F5**  
✅ - Interactive menu selection for all CMake tasks - **F7**  
✅ - Configure  
✅ - Cross Compile  
✅ - Clean  
✅ - Install  
✅ - C/C++ Lint - **ctrl+alt+l**  
✅ - C/C++ format (clang) - **ctrl+alt+m**  
✅ - CMake format - **ctrl+alt+f**

### TODO

- port to Windows, Mac
- some tests, sanitizing, ...

### Code Codex

I am using 🐫amel🐫ode🐫apitals.  
One exception: No capital letter in the "include" folder is intentional!

### Quick Start

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4ea71f7-7e01-4d77-a4cb-1dbc4ab33088

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake -y
git clone https://github.com/tomasmark79/MarkWareVCMake
cd MarkWareVCMake/
code .
```

#### Rename your Library and Standalone in seconds

```bash
./TemplateRenamer.sh <old_lib_name> <new_lib_name> <old_standalone_name> <new_standalone_name>
```

### Template Parts Explanation

#### `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json`

CPM is able to use cache. The path to the cache folder is stored here.

#### `.vscode/tasks.json` and `CMakeConfigure.sh`

Both files are used to smoothly glue CMake and VSCode. The result is a light and robust mechanism for controlling all CMake tasks.

#### `.vscode/launch.json`

It is the debugger definition. Thanks to predictability, it is defined out of the box. ;-)

#### `.vscode/keybindings.json`

My own keybindings. If you want to use them, you need to copy/paste the content to your user settings in `~/.config/Code/${user}/keybindings.json`.

### About Me 👨‍💻

"The result of a lot of hours of incredible fun. Time seemed to stand still. The outcome is a template that takes C++ development to a whole new level.
