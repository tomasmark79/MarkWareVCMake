## Introduction

üåüüåüüåü  

This template started as a small C++ project and gradually became larger and larger. From the very beginning, I created the template with the goal of having a flexibly designed solution. As I gradually added more and more important features, the project may seem quite large at first glance. However, every file in the project structure has its justification, and nothing is unnecessarily redundant.

**Note:** To understand this project, you will need several hours, maybe days. The reward should be that you will subsequently be able to build any large project within 30 minutes, which will stand on solid foundations of the modern world.

## Integrated Tools and Configurations

The project contains its own **Main.cpp**, which is the main entry point for the standalone executable. It also includes **one header file** and **one implementation file** for the library. Thus, the project consists of one executable file and one library that is linked to this executable file. Together, they work in tandem.

The project also includes custom Python scripts that manage the entire workflow. These scripts come with preconfigured CMake settings, task configurations, debugger settings, and more. Everything is ready and functional right out of the box.

**Note:** The only requirement is to have all the **dependencies installed** that this project needs to function correctly.

As you can see, there is quite a bit that needs to be correctly installed on your system. Additionally, cross-tool tools are missing here, which are used to create a toolchain tailored precisely to your requirements.

**Note:** Combining Conan 2 and CPM.cmake is generally not recommended, but it is not prohibited either. If you approach the dependency management concept with Conan 2 as the primary dependency manager and CPM.cmake as a supplementary dependency manager, everything will be fine. **Just make sure to watch out for conflicts.**

## Quick start

### Linux, MacOS

1. Update system packages:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   sudo apt install cmake python3-pip curl git libssl-dev \
   libbz2-dev libcurses-ocaml-dev build-essential gdb libffi-dev \
   libsqlite3-dev liblzma-dev libreadline-dev libtk-img-dev
   ```

2. Install and configure **Pyenv**:
   ```bash
   curl https://pyenv.run | bash
   pyenv install 3.9.2
   pyenv virtualenv 3.9.2 env392
   pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

3. Install **Conan** via Python:
   ```bash
   pip install conan
   conan profile detect --force
   ```  

### Windows native ü™ü

1. Install and configure **Pyenv** in Powershell:  
   [Powershell Installation Steps](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win/blob/master/docs/installation.md#powershell)  
    ```powershell
    pyenv install 3.9.2
    pyenv global 3.9.2
    pyenv local 3.9.2
    pip install --upgrade pip
    ```

3. Install **Conan** in Powershell:
    ```powershell
    pip install conan
    conan profile detect --force
    ```  

### Windows ü™ü via WSL üêß

1. Enable WSL in Powershell and install for ex. Debian based distro:
   ```powershell
   wsl --install
   wsl --list --online
   wsl --install Debian
   wsl --set-default-version 2
   shutdown /r
   ```

2. Install required VSCode extensions:
   - `ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl`
   - `ms-vscode.cpptools`  

3. Connect to WSL and open the project in VSCode
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

---

## Let`s go to start clone repo and build your first project!

üöÄüöÄüöÄ  

1. Clone the template:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tomasmark79/MarkWareVCMake
   cd MarkWareVCMake/
   ```

2. You may rename Standalone and Library name:
   ```bash
   python SolutionRenamer.py VCMLib MyLibrary VCMStandalone MyStandalone
   ```

3. Open the project in VSCode:
   ```bash
   code .
   ```
4. If you have all the necessary dependencies installed, set up the keyboard shortcuts for convenient control. These shortcuts are already prepared for you in the `keybindings.json` file. You need to copy the content into the system `keybindings.json` file, which can be found through the VSCode settings.

5. Once the keyboard shortcuts are functional, you can start controlling the entire setup.

6. Press `Shift+F7` to display the menu where you can choose from the available actions.

7. To simplify things at the beginning, just hit `**üöÄ Zero to Build**`. If everything is in order, tarball archives will be created in the `Build/Artefacts` folder at the end of the process. If not, you will see an error that you need to fix to complete the build process.

## Conan profiles & Compilers Toolchains

If you have installed at least the essential packages for building software, the default compiler of the distribution should be set up in your system. This default compiler will be used if you use the `default` architecture in the template. It is more than likely that you will want to modify your compiler settings over time. You can do this in the `tasks.json` and `SolutionController.py` files, where you can change or add names.

Since Conan profiles are primarily used in the template, you will want to customize the individual configuration. As an example, here is a Conan profile for cross-compiling to Raspberry Pi 4.

```ini
[settings]
os=Linux
arch=armv8
compiler=gcc
compiler.cppstd=17
compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11
compiler.version=12
#compiler.threads=posix
build_type=Release

## Controll

### Configured shortcuts

| | | |
|-|-|-|
|`F5`| **Debuging** | Launch Standalone process with active debugger. |
|`F7`| **üî® Build [s]** | Just Fast (Re)Build Standalone. |
|`SHIFT+F7`| **Show Task Menu** | Menu with tasks to manage buildings, etc. | 
|`Shift+Ctrl+S`| **Permutate scenarios ‚òï** | Does **üöÄ Zero to Build** for all architectures and build types. May be chanhed on demand to fit your testing needs. |
| | | |

### Task Menu

**Note**: If you are building sources with the **Standalone task**, **it will also automaticaly build the library** because the library source code is part of the Standalone source code. The separate tasks for Standalone `[s]`, Library `[l]`, and both `[sl]` are provided for specific needs and developer convenience.

| Task Menu | Description of individual steps |
|-|-|
| **üöÄ Zero to Build** | Clean ‚Üí Conan install ‚Üí CMake configure ‚Üí Build |
| **ü¶∏ Zero to Hero** | Clean ‚Üí Conan install ‚Üí CMake configure ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Install Artefacts ‚Üí Release Tarballs |
| **üßπ Clean folder** | Removes oarticular folder |
| **üó°Ô∏è Conan install** | Prepare dependencies and CMake generators |
| **üîß CMake configure** | Configures CMake |
| **ü™≤ CMake configure with debugger** | Configures CMake with a debugger. Requires CMake > 3.27 & CMake Tools VSCode extension. An awesome feature to debug CMakeLists.txt files. It is simple: add a breakpoint to any line in CMakeLists.txt and start this task. If a message `Running with debugger on.` and `Waiting for debugger client to connect...` appears in the console, you have to launch the `Debug CMake configuration` task defined in launch.json. Or press Ctrl+C to break this action. |
| **üî® Build** `F7` | Builds the project. |
| **üìú Collect licenses** | Gathers licenses from CPM dependencies. |
| **üìå Install artefacts** | Installs to **/Build/Installed/**. |
| **üì¶ Release tarballs** | Creates tarballs in **/Build/Artifacts/**. |
| **‚öîÔ∏è Conan graph.html** | Creates an HTML output of Conan dependencies. |
|-|-|
| **üîç lint** `Ctrl+Alt+L` | Runs diagnostics on C/C++ files. |
| **üìê clang-format** `Ctrl+Alt+F` | Formats all project C/C++ files. |
| **üìè cmake-format** `Ctrl+Alt+M` | Formats all project CMake files. |

## Special Operations

### Rename script for Standalone & Library renaming

When you clone my template to your local disk at the beginning, one of the first things you will want to do is **rename** the names of the standalone application and the library. If this had to be done manually, it would be very cumbersome, so I created another Python script. `SolutionRenamer.py` changes all the necessary strings, including those that define object classes. **It is ideal to use this renaming right at the beginning to avoid manual work later on.**


### Upgrade Itself

Since the template is continuously evolving, I have also created an additional Python script, `SolutionUpgrader.py`, which allows updating the uncommented files defined within this script. Open the script and uncomment the files you want to be updated. The script creates a backup in case you accidentally update a file that was important to you. The update process involves downloading the latest files from the GitHub repository.

---

## Additional Build Settings

### The solution creates 4 build types as a classic CMake Layout

- `Debug`, `Release`, `RelWithDebInfo`, `MinSizeRel`

### Conan 2 and cmake_layout

**Note**: Since this is a custom workflow solution, it is prohibited to use CMake Layout in the `conanfile.py` settings. Other options can be used.

```python
   # it should remain commented
    # def layout(self):
      # cmake_layout(self)
```       

### Useful Variables and Tips for CMakeLists.txt

```cmake
   option(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS "Build using shared libraries" OFF)
   option(USE_STATIC_RUNTIME "Link against static runtime libraries" ON)
```

#### Static Linking of Libraries
When correctly statically linking all source components, the resulting executable file is the only thing needed to run the application correctly, whether on the development platform or another transferred device.

#### Dynamic Linking of Libraries
When dynamically linking external libraries to our Standalone, all dynamic libraries must be available. On the native platform where we are currently developing, dynamic libraries are automatically accessible. However, when transferring the compiled Standalone/Library to another device or platform, dynamic libraries cannot be handled automatically. Therefore, the developer must ensure the availability of dynamic libraries on the foreign system. **The simplest** **way** to ensure the availability of dynamic libraries from the source platform on a foreign platform is to extract these libraries from the `host` folder, which **Conan** generates during the dependency installation preparation. The `host` folder is always located in the `Build` folder and is the result of Conan's dependency preparation. The `host` content is created thanks to `--deployer=full_deploy` argument when conan is installing.
 - https://docs.conan.io/2/examples/extensions/deployers/dev/development_deploy.html#examples-extensions-builtin-deployers-development

**Be aware that Install and Artefacts folders are containing only CMakeLists.txt targets.**

### The project also supports cross-compilation

**Note**: You will normally use the `Default` setting out of the box because it uses the compiler found in the system. Conan created a profile named `default` using the `conan profile detect` command, and this profile will be used by this setting.

Other settings are essentially additional profiles for the Conan manager that I have created using existing toolchains and actively use. For this reason, I have left them in the template for you as well. 

- `x86_64-bookworm-linux-gnu` (requires cross-compilation toolchain)  
- `x86_64-w64-mingw32` (requires cross-compilation toolchain)  
- `aarch64-linux-gnu` (requires cross-compilation toolchain)  

It is easy to add a new architecture.

---

## Command Line

### Command Line Control
Command line control of projects is also available.

**The real intention of this template is to completely avoid the command line unless absolutely necessary.**

However, there may be situations where manual work is required. Therefore, I have provided some task scenarios as examples. You can extract these commands yourself from the `SolutionController.log` file, which is automatically created in the main directory of the project's file system when using VSCode tasks. In any case, if Visual Studio Code is not available, you can maintain the projects using just command line commands.

## ToDo

Consider to implement
 - CMakePresets.json a CMakeUserPresets.json
 - Hardening
 - ipo
 - pch?
 - cpack?
