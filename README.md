## Getting Started

### Linux Installers

This project provides a set of installer scripts in the `.init` folder for setting up a development environment on various Linux distributions from scratch, including Debian-based systems, Fedora, Arch Linux, and OpenSUSE. Each script automates the installation of essential packages, tools, and configurations needed for development. Windows 10/11 and MacOS are also included.

```bash

# Debian based (Tested Debian Bookworm 12.9, Ubuntu 22.04)

curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomasmark79/MarkWareVCMake/main/.init/DebianBasedInstaller.sh | bash

# Fedora (Tested Fedora 40, 41)

curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomasmark79/MarkWareVCMake/main/.init/FedoraInstaller.sh | bash

# Arch (required contributor)

curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomasmark79/MarkWareVCMake/main/.init/ArchInstaller.sh | bash

# OpenSUSE (required contributor)

curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomasmark79/MarkWareVCMake/main/.init/OpenSUSEInstaller.sh | bash

# Windows 10/11 (script dev in progress)
powershell -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomasmark79/MarkWareVCMake/main/.init/WindowsInstaller.ps1' -OutFile 'WindowsInstaller.ps1'; Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; .\WindowsInstaller.ps1"

# MacOS (required contributor)

```

## Development Workflow

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Shift+F7`: TASK MENU (standalone, library, both)  
- `F7`: 🔨 Quick build Standalone  
- `F5`: 🪲 Quick debug Standalone  
- `Ctrl+Alt+R`: just Launch Standalone binary  
- `Ctrl+Alt+L`: 🔍 clang-tidy
- `Ctrl+Alt+F`: 📐 clang-format  
- `Ctrl+Alt+M`: 📏 cmake-format 

### Automatic Tasks

By `Shift+F7` invoked **TASK MENU** includes the following automation commands:  

- 🚀 Zero to Build means 🧹 🗡️ 🔧 🔨
- 🦸 Zero to Hero means  🧹 🗡️ 🔧 🔨 📌 🗜️
- 🧹 Clean build directories  
- 🗡️ Dependency installation with Conan 2  
- 🔧 CMake configuration  
- 🪲 CMake configuration with CMake 🦉 debugger  
- 🔨 Build (Re-Build F7)  
- 📜 License collection with CPM for CPM  
- 📌 Install artefacts

### CMake Build Options

Supports multiple build types hardcoded in `tasks.json`:
```txt
Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo, MinSizeRel
```

Configurable CMake options for:  
  
`BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`, `USE_STATIC_RUNTIME`, `SANITIZE_ADDRESS`, `SANITIZE_UNDEFINED`, `SANITIZE_THREAD`, `SANITIZE_MEMORY`, `ENABLE_HARDENING`, `ENABLE_IPO`, `ENABLE_CCACHE`

### CLI Build everything at once

Build standalone part will also build library if linked in CMake configuration.

```bash
conan install "." --output-folder="./build/standalone/default/debug" --deployer=full_deploy --build=missing --profile default --settings build_type=Debug
source "./build/standalone/default/debug/conanbuild.sh" && cmake -S "./standalone" -B "./build/standalone/default/debug" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="conan_toolchain.cmake" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="./build/installation/default/debug"
source "./build/standalone/default/debug/conanbuild.sh" && cmake --build "./build/standalone/default/debug"  -j 16
source "./build/standalone/default/debug/conanbuild.sh" && cmake --build "./build/standalone/default/debug" --target install -j 16

```

## Additional Features

### Cross-Compilation Support

The template includes preconfigured menu items. The default Conan profile represents the default value in the buildArch definition. Other profiles can be edited and supplemented according to your existing Conan profiles.

```json
{
    /* ARCH ITEMS */
    "id": "buildArch",
    "type": "pickString",
    "description": "Select target architecture",
    "options": [
        "default", 
        "x86_64-clang-linux-gnu",
        "x86_64-w64-mingw32",
        "aarch64-rpi4-linux-gnu"
    ],
    "default": "default"
}
```

### Project Maintenance

#### Renaming

by python script `SolutionRenamer.py`  

#### Upgrade custom template parts
by pyton script `SolutionUpgrader.py`  

#### Log using history

in existing log file  `Solution.log`  

### Template Structure

*Template is using Two projects in One Solution.*

```txt
MarkWareVCMake/
├── include/
```
Contains **library project** public header files (.hpp) intended for use in other projects or modules.

```txt
MarkWareVCMake/
├── src/
```
Contains **library project** source files (.cpp) and `internal` header files (.hpp) that are not intended for public use.

```txt
MarkWareVCMake/
├── standalone/
```
Contains just **standalone** project.

### Standalone arguments

*Template C++ is using basic [cxxopt](https://github.com/jarro2783/cxxopts/tree/v3.2.1) implementation to smart manage passed arguments for Standalone*  

  - `-a` omitt assets loading
  - `-o` omitt library loading
  - `-h` show help

## Conventions

To avoid future issues with folder and file names, I have set these rules.

 - **All standard template folders**, including those generated later, **use lowercase letters only**.
 - User-defined folders can contain any combination of uppercase and lowercase letters.
 - All **C** and **C++** files provided in the template will use **CamelCase convention**, including an **uppercase letter at the beginning**.

### Indentation

C/C++ 2 spaces  
Python 4 spaces  

## FAQ

`Q:` **Build task error**  
Error: /home/.../Build/Standalone/default/Debug is not a directory  
Error: /home/.../Build/Library/default/Debug is not a directory  
`A:` There is nothing to build. You must first create the configurations for the product, and only then can you compile separately with the build task. The "Zero to Build," "Zero to Hero," or CMake configuration tasks will help you create the configuration, which can then be compiled.

`Q:` **CMake-tidy error**  
Error while trying to load a compilation database: Could not auto-detect compilation database from directory, etc.  
`A:` For static code analysis to work correctly, you need to have the CMake configurations prepared. Also, ensure that the `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS` variable is set to `ON` in CMakeLists.txt.

## Tips

`xxd -i file.bin > file.h`

## Thanks

To everyone who supported me in creating this template. These are various people and information from the web. Of course, also literature and courses that I have taken in the past. Various Discord servers and individuals who took a moment to make an indelible mark on this amazing work for me. Thank you very much!
